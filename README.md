# VAMK Timetable API

Official timetables for students & professors at VAMK are available online as tables in HTML pages.
There is several problems to this approach :
- There is no semantic, humans can read the schedules but they are hard to parse for a computer.
- You can't export them easily to Google Calendar or your favorite calendar app.
