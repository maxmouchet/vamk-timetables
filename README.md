[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maxmouchet/vamk-timetables.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maxmouchet/vamk-timetables)

Better timetables for the Vaasa University of Applied Sciences.

Official timetables for students & professors at the are available online as tables in HTML pages.
There is several problems to this approach :  
- There is no semantic, humans can read the schedules but they are hard to parse for a computer.  
- You can't export them easily to Google Calendar or your favorite calendar app.  
- It's not mobile friendly.

## Features
- JSON API for courses, groups, and schedules.
- Web user interface for creating and sharing custom timetables.
- Extensible parsing system that supports multiple sources and outputs.

## API
See the [documentation on Apiary](http://docs.vamktimetables.apiary.io).
